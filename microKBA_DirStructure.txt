microKBA/Data
│   
├───Events		data of events, generated using 'Process/Kinesin track analyzer' option of 'Single Molecule Biophysics' ImageJ plug-in 
│   │			(s_m_b.jar available on figshare  http://www.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14071382)
│   │
│   ├───Events_byRegion_All       	 	   all events data, split by experiment and tracking region        	     
│   ├───Events_byRegion_Sel       	 	   selected/filtered events, split by experiment and tracking region        	   
│   ├───Events_byExp_PlusMSDy       	 	   event data with appended mean square displacement in y (see Force Estimation), split by experiment 
│   ├───Events_byExp_PlusForce      	 	   event data with appended force (see Force Estimation), split by experiment 
│   └───Events_byExp_compiled         	           event data with appended force (see Force Estimation), compiled into one file
│
├───PeakCount	count of all detected peaks in the consecutive frames of the image sequence, 
│ 		used to identify when the ATP arrives to the flow cells and motility of motors 
│ 	        starts (and detachment rate increases), 
│   		executed using ‘Process/Peak Finder’ option in the Single Molecule Biophysics plug-in (s_m_b.jar) in ImageJ
│
└───Traces	each folder contains tracking results generated with ‘Process/Fast Fitter Tracker v2’ option of 
		'Single Molecule Biophysics' ImageJ plug-in, filtered for standard deviation in y, separated by tracking regions,
		as well as start/end times marking the trajectory part used for beads fluctuation analysis
    

microKBA/Figure Plotting
│
└───Contains MatLab scripts that generate manuscript figures from /Data


microKBA/Figures
│
└───Contains results of /Figure Plotting and images used for figures


microKBA/Force Estimation
│
└───Contains scripts that execute force estimation for each experiment, starting with estimating mean square displacement in y

microKBA/Localisation precision
│
└───Contains data and script necessary to compute localisation precision from traces of stuck beads
